## Applied Data Science Capstone Project

All necessary data and jupyter notebooks are provided in the "Cologne" folder


**Introduction** 

Cologne is one of the biggest Cities in germany and with over 100.000 students a city with a deeply entrenched youth culture. The city and its 86 Neighboordhoods called "Veedel" (cologne dialect for: "Viertel) are very diverse and populated with around one million inhabittants. _Intro BLABLA

I want to consider a fictious Business Problem of a marketing consultancy that helps local companies with their advertising campain. The consultancy will deliver an algorithm that clusters the neighborhood according to different categorical inputs regarding demographical and socialeconomical factors. For the most cost efficienct marketing mix it is necessary to approach the correct costumer. Cluster neighboorhood is a feasible step to distribute the marketing effort more efficienctly. The algorithm of the marketing consultancy will help local companies for a better approach on microtargeting the right costumers in the right Neighborhoods as different cluster may exhibit different consumer elasticities. I will show in the following the different opportunities to cluster a city with four different features that are aggregated and engineered from different data sources. It can be shown that an efficient clustering of the neighborhood is a consistent approach that delivers a clear output if the assumption of internally homogenous neighborhoods holds.

As a disclaimer: I won't discuss any implication from the assigned clusters on the neighboorhoods nor will I deliver any marketing advice. Furthermore it needs to be said that the clustering can exhibit "rational discrimination" that deilveres "segmeted monocultures" to quote the Whistleblower from Camebridge Analytica Christopher Wylie. I am against any of those resulting discrimination and very aware about the simplification on social economical factors that can result from clustering on those data.
